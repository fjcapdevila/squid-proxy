# To generate password entries you will need the htpasswd utility. If you have Apache
# installed, you already have it. Otherwise run:

# apt-get install apache2-utils

# Create a username/password pair:

# htpasswd /path/to/squid_passwd user1

# Replace user1 with a username
# You can repeat this step at any time to create new users.

# Other way to do this, is using an online tool, like:
# http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/

# These are some examples (test/test and prueba/prueba)

# prueba:$apr1$bdC46Ctv$Ncvl/AaoxHlg4Io7PMPHC0
# DO NOT USE them in PRODUCTION. Generate your own pairs!

# Paste your entries here
